The SAE J1772 State MachineThe firmware uses a non-blocking state machine to decode the analog Control Pilot (CP) signal. By measuring the voltage drop across the vehicle's internal resistors, the ESP32 manages transitions with millisecond precision:StatePilot VoltageDescriptionFirmware ActionState A$+12\text{V}$Standby / No VehiclePWM Off; Relay OpenState B$+9\text{V} \pm 1$Vehicle DetectedStart PWM; Wait for 'Ready'State C$+6\text{V} \pm 1$Ready to ChargeClose Relay; Monitor LoadState D$+3\text{V} \pm 1$Ventilation RequiredClose Relay; Log Vent StateState E/F$0\text{V} / -12\text{V}$Error / Diode FaultEmergency Stop; Lockout2. Synchronized PWM-Abort SafetyIn high-current AC charging, "Hot Switching" (opening a relay while current is flowing) can cause arcing and degrade the contactor. Our v5.6.6 Kernel implements a "Soft-Stop" sequence:Pilot Abort: The PWM signal is instantly set to $100\%$ duty ($+12\text{V}$ DC). This signals the EV to electronically cease power draw.Zero-Load Break: After a calculated delay, the mechanical relay opens. This ensures the relay never breaks a live load under normal conditions.3. Industrial Supervisor & WatchdogTask Watchdog (WDT): The hardware supervisor is tuned to an 8-second window. If the MQTT or WiFi stack deadlocks, the WDT triggers a hard reset.Pre-Init Lockout: During the boot-up sequence, GPIO 16 (Relay) is hardware-forced LOW before any application code runs, eliminating "boot-glitch" toggles.Anti-Chatter Hysteresis: A $3000\text{ms}$ RELAY_SWITCH_DELAY ensures that noisy Pilot signals or momentary voltage dips don't cause the contactor to cycle rapidly.4. Smart Load Balancing (MQTT)The controller supports dynamic current scaling from $6\text{A}$ to $32\text{A}$. By integrating with Home Assistant and a smart meter, the firmware can "Load Shed"—automatically reducing the EV charge rate when a household appliance (like an oven or heat pump) turns on, protecting your main fuse.

To implement your safety requirements, we need to ensure the Watchdog is actively monitored and that the OTA process can bypass the 3-second RELAY_SWITCH_DELAY logic in your Relay.cpp.

The openImmediately() function you already have is perfect for this—we just need to call it in the right places.

1. The Professional "Safety-First" Implementation
Here is how your main .ino file should look to integrate your Relay class with a Hardware Watchdog and the OTA Emergency Stop:

C++


2. Updated Professional README
Add this technical breakdown to your documentation. It proves to any observer that you have considered the mechanical and electrical risks of EV charging.

🛡️ Industrial Safety Implementation
This firmware implements a high-integrity safety layer to protect the EV battery and the charging infrastructure:

Mechanical Protection (Anti-Chatter)
The Relay driver enforces a RELAY_SWITCH_DELAY of 3000ms. This prevents "relay chatter" (rapid toggling) which can weld contactor points or damage the vehicle's onboard charger (OBC).

Hardware Watchdog (WDT)
A hardware-level supervisor (esp_task_wdt) monitors the execution of the main loop. If a network deadlock occurs in the MQTT or WiFi stack:

The Watchdog triggers an immediate MCU reset.

The bootloader defaults the GPIOs to high-impedance.

Hardware pull-down resistors (recommended 10kΩ) ensure the AC contactor opens instantly.

OTA Interlock
During an Over-The-Air update, the system triggers an openImmediately() call. This bypasses the software-defined debounce timers to ensure that high-voltage AC is physically disconnected before any code modification begins.


🔄 OTA Safe-Shutdown Sequence
To prevent electrical arcing and vehicle-side errors during a firmware update, the controller executes a synchronized shutdown sequence:

Pilot Signaling (State A): The Pilot driver immediately switches the PWM signal to a constant +12V. This signals the vehicle to cease power draw immediately.

State Machine Abort: The EvseCharge logic is placed into a STOP state to prevent any resume commands from being processed during the flash window.

Physical Interruption: The Relay object executes openImmediately(), bypassing the standard 3000ms debounce timer to ensure the AC contactor is open before the ESP32 enters its internal flashing routine.

Project Log: Building a Smart ESP32-Based EVSE
Status: Work in Progress (Firmware v5.6.6)

Date: January 2026

Lead Developer: Noel Vellemans

1. The Core Vision
The goal of this project is to build a robust, DIY electric vehicle charging station (EVSE) that follows the SAE J1772 and IEC 61851 standards while offering modern "smart" features. By using an ESP32 as the brain, the station isn't just a dumb relay—it's a connected device capable of MQTT integration, web-based management, and real-time diagnostics.

2. Current Architecture
The system is built on a modular kernel structure:

The Pilot Driver: A dedicated class that handles the 1kHz PWM signal. It precisely controls the duty cycle to tell the car how many Amps it can pull, while simultaneously monitoring the Pilot voltage to detect the vehicle's state (A through F).

The Charge Controller: This is the logic layer that manages the contactor, safety timers, and state transitions.

The Communication Stack: Featuring a built-in Captive Portal for initial WiFi setup, a custom Web Dashboard for mobile control, and MQTT for future Smart Home (Home Assistant) integration.

3. Latest Milestones
We have recently implemented several "Quality of Life" features that move the project from a prototype to a polished tool:

Dynamic UI Translation: The web interface no longer shows raw numeric codes. It now translates the Pilot voltage into human-readable states like "Ready: Charging" or "Standby: Not Connected."

Intelligent Networking: Switching from DHCP to a Static IP is now a "one-click" process. The firmware detects your current live network parameters (IP, Gateway, and Subnet) and pre-fills the configuration for you.

Deep Diagnostics: A new "Cyan-Green" diagnostic console has been added to the settings menu. It provides a "under the hood" look at the system, including Pilot Voltage (V), Free Heap memory, and Uptime.

4. Technical Challenges & Safety
Safety is the priority. The firmware includes an ESP32 Task Watchdog (WDT). If the software hangs for more than 8 seconds, the system automatically panics and reboots, ensuring the Pilot signal and contactor return to a safe state. We are also currently refining the MQTT Failsafe logic—ensuring that if the charger loses connection to the smart home server, it can either throttle down or stop the session safely.

5. Next Steps
Energy Monitoring: Integrating a power meter (HLW8012 or similar) to track kWh per session.

OTA Refinement: Enhancing the Over-The-Air update stability for remote maintenance.

Enclosure Design: Moving the prototype from the bench into a weather-rated housing.
